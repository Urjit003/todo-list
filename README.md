## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: You need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: npm is installed with Node.js. You can verify it by running the following command in your terminal:

\`\`\`
node -v
npm -v
\`\`\`

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
